To run: java ExamBuilderGUI

ExamBuilder is a GUI application to help educators make exams with different types of questions.
There are short answer questions, multiple choice single answer questions, multiple choice multiple answers questions, 
and numerical questions. 

There are various buttons to make a question, shuffle questions (and answers for MC), save the exam to a file, rename the exam, 
remove questions, and upload an existing exam. 

This application can help educators make exams easily, reuse old exams, and discourage cheating because of the shuffling feature.

There is an ExamGrader and ExamTaker, but the focus is ExamBuilder.
